🔒 Continuation B — Escalation Control

Volition-Bound Termination for Multi-Agent AI Systems


📦 Pinata Mirror (IPFS):https://gold-secondary-impala-253.mypinata.cloud/ipfs/bafkreigrc2xgeplsvkirrzfxtbeorbz4kejxj57a4y5fpxaoklknthubfq

🧠 Overview

This module introduces a structural safety framework for multi-agent AI ecosystems, enforcing execution termination when systems escalate beyond coherence. It is the second continuation of the Volition-Bound AI stack and applies specifically to recursive agents, planning swarms, and generative orchestrators.

🧩 Key Innovations

Conflict Persistence Trigger
Terminates execution after unresolved inter-agent disagreement exceeds threshold cycles.

Justification Loop Detection
Ends self-reinforcing agent cycles where no new input or novelty is introduced.

Marginal Information Decay
Detects stagnation in system output and enforces stop conditions.

Override-Resistant Termination
Ensures that no agent, user, or prompt can bypass a structural halt once triggered.

🛡️ Why It Matters

Existing AI systems attempt to resolve conflict.
This system acknowledges when resolution has structurally failed — and stops.

Escalation is not an edge case — it is the default state of recursive coordination under drift.
